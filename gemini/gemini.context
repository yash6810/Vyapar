This session focused on improving the Vyapar application. Here is a summary of the work done:

- **Modular Architecture:** Refactored the application into a modular architecture with separate services for different functionalities like ASR, intent classification, and the main backend.
- **AI-based Intent Detection:** Upgraded the intent detection from a rule-based system to an AI-based system that uses a language model for more accurate and flexible intent classification.
- **Production-Ready WhatsApp Integration:** Prepared the WhatsApp adapter for production use with clear instructions on how to configure it with API credentials.
- **Comprehensive Test Suite:** Added a comprehensive test suite with unit tests and end-to-end tests for all the major features.
- **Robust Error Handling:** Implemented robust error handling to gracefully handle service outages and other unexpected errors.
- **Detailed Logging:** Added detailed logging with request ID tracing, which makes it easier to debug and monitor the application.
- **Health Check Endpoint:** Added a `/health` endpoint to monitor the status of the application and its dependent services.
- **Expense and Invoice Summaries:** Implemented daily, monthly, and yearly summaries for both expenses and invoices.
- **Flexible Date Parsing:** Added flexible date parsing for expenses and invoices.
- **Multi-currency Support:** Added support for multiple currencies for expenses and invoices.
- **Generic Document Processing:** Refactored the document processing logic to be more generic and extensible, which will make it easier to add support for other document types in the future.
- **Expanded Audio Format Support:** The ASR service now supports a wider range of audio formats, including `.ogg` and `.flac`.
- **Search by Vendor:** Added the ability to search for expenses and invoices by vendor.
- **Tagging:** Added tagging functionality for expenses and invoices.
- **Created `task.md`:** Created a `task.md` file that summarizes all the work done and provides instructions on how to run the application.
