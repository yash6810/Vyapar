# Introduction to Goods and Services Tax (GST) in India

Goods and Services Tax (GST) is an indirect tax used in India on the supply of goods and services. It is a comprehensive, multistage, destination-based tax: comprehensive because it has subsumed almost all the indirect taxes except a few state taxes. Multi-staged as it is, the GST is imposed at every step in the production process, but it is meant to be refunded to all parties in the various stages of production other than the final consumer. Destination-based, it is collected from point of consumption and not point of origin like previous taxes.

## Key Features of GST
- **Dual GST Model:** GST is levied by both the Central Government (CGST) and the State Governments (SGST) on intra-state supplies. For inter-state supplies, the Integrated GST (IGST) is levied by the Central Government.
- **Input Tax Credit (ITC):** One of the most important features of GST is the Input Tax Credit system. ITC allows you to claim the tax already paid on inputs when you pay tax on your output. This mechanism reduces the cascading effect of taxes.
- **GST Council:** The GST Council is a constitutional body responsible for making recommendations to the Union and State Government on issues related to GST.
- **HSN Code:** The Harmonized System of Nomenclature (HSN) code is used to classify goods for taxation purposes.

## GST Slabs
There are primarily four GST tax slabs in India:
- **5%:** Common use items.
- **12%:** Standard rate for many goods.
- **18%:** Standard rate for many services and a wide range of goods.
- **28%:** Luxury items and sin goods.
Some items like essential food grains are zero-rated, while a few items like petrol and alcohol are outside the purview of GST.
