# GST Invoicing Rules

A GST invoice is a bill or receipt of items sold or services provided by the seller to the customer. A tax invoice is an essential document for the recipient to claim Input Tax Credit (ITC).

## Mandatory Fields on a GST Invoice
According to the GST Act, a tax invoice must include the following details:
1.  Invoice number and date.
2.  Customer name.
3.  Shipping and billing address.
4.  Customer and taxpayer’s GSTIN (Goods and Services Tax Identification Number).
5.  Place of supply.
6.  HSN/SAC code.
7.  Item details i.e. description, quantity (number), unit (meter, kg etc.), total value.
8.  Taxable value and discounts.
9.  Rate and amount of taxes i.e. CGST/SGST/IGST.

## When to Issue a GST Invoice
- **For Goods (Normal Supply):** On or before the date of removal or delivery of goods.
- **For Goods (Continuous Supply):** On or before the date of issue of statement or receipt of payment.
- **For Services:** Within 30 days from the date of supply of service. For banks and NBFCs, it is 45 days.

## E-Invoicing
E-invoicing or electronic invoicing is a system in which B2B invoices are electronically authenticated by GSTN for further use on the common GST portal. As of 2023, it is mandatory for businesses with an aggregate turnover of ₹5 crore or more in any preceding financial year from 2017-18 onwards. The main objective is to reduce tax evasion.
